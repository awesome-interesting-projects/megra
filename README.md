# Mégra

Mégra is a mini-language to make music with variable-order markov chains
and some other stochastic shenanigans.

## Installation
There are currently two ways to install. One uses **Portacle** as the underlying editor 
and is comparatively easy. You can find the instructions here:

If you're familar with Common Lisp and Emacs, and want to integrate Mégra into your current
Emacs installation, please find some hints here:

Please check the tutorial (in the folder of the same name) for notes on usage !

## Technicalities

Mégra is an embedded domain-specific language based on **Common Lisp**,
Tito Latini's amazing **Incudine** library and **Common Music 2.x**, which
is old but working, and currently (inofficially and as needed) maintained
by Orm Finnendahl.

## Basic Concepts
(to be expanded ...)

* Variable-Order Markov Chains
* Event Streaming and Manipulation
* Musical Event Arithmetics
* Wall-Clock Time
