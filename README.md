# Mégra

Mégra is a mini-language to make music with variable-order markov chains
and some other stochastic shenanigans.

## Installation
There are currently two ways to install. One uses **Portacle** as the underlying editor 
and is comparatively easy. You can find the instructions here:

https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/megra/blob/master/Tutorial/00_Installation.md

If you're familar with Common Lisp and Emacs, and want to integrate Mégra into your current
Emacs installation, please find some hints here:

## Differences between 1.x and 2.x
Some features didn't make it over to 2.x because they were too complicated, or caused too much clutter.

Amongst those are:

* The branch/cut feature. There's more intuitive and concise methods like `(xdup)`that do something very similar.
* The chain group feature. I only used it once, it hasn't even been documented, and the `(sx)` environment does a better job.git 
* Controller input. This has been obsolete for a long time ...
* Manual cloning. Never documented, never used.

In the very unlikely case that you were an early Mégra user and are missing one of the features, please tell me and I'll see if
I can bring them back, or think about a good alternative. Otherwise, you can still use the 1.x branch.

## Learning

Currently, there are two Tutorials. 

The *new*, main tutorial is in the making. It provides more in-depth explanations
about the inner workings of Mégra. Please find it in:

https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/megra/blob/master/Tutorial/

The historical, *old* tutorial was written as the language
evolved. It covers a good lot of the language, but the order in which things are explained might not be 
all that reasonable. You can find it in:

## Technicalities

Mégra is an embedded domain-specific language based on **Common Lisp**,
Tito Latini's amazing **Incudine** library and **Common Music 2.x**, which
is old but working, and currently (inofficially and as needed) maintained
by Orm Finnendahl.
