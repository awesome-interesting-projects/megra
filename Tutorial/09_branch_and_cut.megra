;; (in case you didn't notice the risset bell sound before ...)
(s 'bell ()  
  (lifemodel t 0.1 'triloop 15 :lifespan 33 :durs '(400 200 200 100)
	  (nuc 'construction (risset 1000 :atk (oscil 4 100 :cycle 20)
			     :lvl 0.1 :sus 300 :rel 400 :rev 0.1)
	       :gap 400 :reset t)))


;; wouldn't it be nice if we could add a different "voice", lets say,
;; an octave higher ? here we go ... 
(branch 'bell :variance 0.1 :functors '(((pitch) (* 2))))

;; the whole construction is branched, and forms an autonomous entity
;; that develops a life of it's own ...

;; let's add another to the stack, a bass voice, with higher
;; variance 
(branch 'bell :variance 0.5 :functors '(((pitch) (* 0.2))))

;; functors can be applied to any parameter
(branch 'bell :variance 0.6 :functors '(((rel) (* 0.2))))

;; now, if it's a little too much, let's drop the layers one by one ..
;; cut the last branch ...
(cut 'bell)

;; or all of them at once ...
(cutall 'bell)

;; another way of branching:
(s 'bell (:branch t) ;; the branch flag means the modified
  ;; version will be pushed to the stack ...
  ;; (evaluate code multiple times)
  (lifemodel t 0.1 'triloop 15 :lifespan 33 :durs '(400 200 200 100)
	  (nuc 'construction (risset 2000 :atk (oscil 4 100 :cycle 20)
			     :lvl 0.1 :sus 300 :rel 400 :rev 0.1)
	       :gap 400 :reset t)))

;; in this case, the version you create (modifiying the parameters by hand)
;; will be pushed on top of the stack ...

;; (cut) and (cutall) work slightly different whether you use the explicit, or
;; flag branching method.
;; In the first case, the branch versions will be cut until only the original
;; version is left.
;; With the flag method, it behaves more like queue, and the versions will be
;; cut from the back until only the last version is left.
