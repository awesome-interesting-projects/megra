# Mégra Installation Guide

This is the new version of the Mégra installation guide, which attempts to give easier access to
the Mégra Language.

It focuses on using Mégra with **Portacle** (https://portacle.github.io), a self-contained Common Lisp
Editor that already comes with all kinds of helpers. This is especially helpful for people who don't have
a lot of experience with the Common Lisp environment.

* [Linux](#Linux)
* [macOS](#macOS)
* [Windows](#Windows) 

## Linux
Make sure you have the following programs up and running: 

* JACK (jack2 preferred)
* SuperCollider (3.8 or later)
* sc3-plugins
* gcc

If not, now is the time to use your distro's package manager to install them. While you're at it,
also install the following:

* libsndfile
* fftw
* portaudio 
* portmidi
* gsl
* graphviz
* git
* wget

Now, download **Portacle** from https://portacle.github.io and extract it to a location of your choice (I'd recommend you home folder). **NOTE:** if you already have portacle in use, I heavily recommend using a separate installation dedicated to Mégra.

Navigate to the portacle folder (that is, the folder you just extracted) and execute:

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-drunk-coder/megra/master/portacle-bootstrap-linux.sh```

Run the bootstrap script:

```chmod +x portacle-boostrap-linux.sh && ./portacle-boostrap-linux.sh```

Now just run Portacle with the `portacle.run` script, and you'll end up directly in a Mégra file where you can start hacking around. Per default, the files are stored in the `megra-sketchbook` folder that lives in your Portacle folder now.

In the default installation, there's a few samples that'll be enough for the tutorial. Copy or link your samples into the `megra-samples` folder you'll find in the Portacle root folder. The structure is similar to *TidalCycles*, samples are organized in folders. 

## macOS

Mégra runs on macOS from version 10.11 onwards, even though I'd recommend at least 10.12, the oldest supported version as of 2019.

Make sure you have the following programs up and running: 

* SuperCollider (3.8 or later)
* sc3-plugins

If not, you can find those here:
* SuperCollider: https://supercollider.github.io/download
* sc3-plugins: https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins

You need a C/C++ compiler to install certain libraries (don't worry, you don't have to interact with it in any way).
To check whether you do, open a terminal, type `cc` and press `Return`. If you see something along the lines of
`clang: error: no input files found`, you should be all set.

If not, open a terminal and enter `xcode-select --install` to install the necessary command line tools. For a more detailed
instructions, see: https://developpaper.com/install-command-line-tools-no-xcode-in-mac-os-x/.

Now make sure you have the following packages installed:
* libsndfile
* fftw
* portaudio 
* portmidi
* gsl
* graphviz
* git
* wget

I recommend **Homebrew** to install them. If you do not have homebrew, here's instructions on how to get it: https://brew.sh .
With homebrew installed, just open a terminal and type:

```brew install libsndfile fftw portaudio portmidi gsl graphviz git wget```

If you have some other package manager like *macPorts* installed, you might use that as well, in which case I assume you know what you're doing.

Now you need to get portacle. Here's a guide how to get Portacle running despite Apple's security theatre: https://portacle.github.io/#get-mac . It works! After you've been through the process, you can start Portacle like any other application from your *Finder*. As a hint, do NOT put portacle in your global *Applications* folder, instead just move the *portacle* folder from the DMG to your home folder, or Desktop if you want. **NOTE:** if you already have portacle in use, I heavily recommend using a separate installation dedicated to Mégra.

Then, get the bootstrap script by navigating to the portacle folder in the terminal and execute the following: 

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-drunk-coder/megra/master/portacle-bootstrap-macos.sh```

After that, type the following to run the bootstrap script:

```chmod +x portacle-boostrap-macos.sh && ./portacle-boostrap-macos.sh```

This pulls all the necessary projects to the necessary places. Now, if you start portacle, you'll end up directly in a Mégra file where you can start hacking around. Per default, the files are stored in the `megra-sketchbook` folder that lives in your portacle folder now.

The macOS version might not support MIDI right now, or at least it might have sync problems. Working on that. Not that MIDI support is really documented, anyway.

### Troubleshooting

If you see an error "Division by Zero" while Portacle is starting and loading the Mégra system, make sure all samplerates of all programs are set to 48000 (or, if you've changed that in your ~/.incudinerc, the respective samplerate). It happens if there's a samplerate mismatch. If you have another audio application running (i.e. Reaper), it might change the samplerate if you pull that window into focus !

## Windows
Now, I must admit that I don't have stable access to a Windows machine, and I'm not well-versed anymore 
in operating one. I know that Portacle works on Windows (tried it on Windows 7), and so does SuperCollider.
SBCL thread support is needed by the underlying Incudine system, which is notoriously fragile on the Windows port.
Another problem is that you need to compile the several dependencies (like portaudio and portmidi)
by hand, so you'd need to be well-versed in Windows development. If you anybody is willing to try, please let
me know.
