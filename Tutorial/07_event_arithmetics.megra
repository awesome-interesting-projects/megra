;; 07 - Event "Arithmetics" and Taxonomy

;; Look at those two events:

(s 'demo-wave ()
   (g 'wave
      (n 1 (tri 40 :dur 400 :lvl 0.4))
      (e 1 1 :d 400 :p 100)))

(s 'demo-sn ()
   (g 'snare
      (n 1 (sn 'fat :dur 400 :lvl 0.4))
      (e 1 1 :d 400 :p 100)))

;; Even though they sound quite different, they have a lot in common.
;; Both have duration, level, and, if you look at all possible parameters,
;; filter frequencies, attack, decay, etc ...
