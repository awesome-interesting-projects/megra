## Simple Synth Events 

**Syntax**: 
```lisp 
(sine|saw|sqr|par|cub|tri <pitch> <keyword parameters>)
```

**Example** 
```lisp
(sine 110) ;; with frequency
(sine 'a2 :rev 0.1) ;; with note name and reverb
```

### Types
| Type |Description|
|-----------|:-------:|
| sine | simple sine wave |
| cub  | a sine like shape made of two cubic pieces (LFCub) |
| par  | a sine-like shape made of two parabolas and the integral of a triangular wave (LFPar) |
| tri  | a triangle wave |
| sqr  | a square wave   |
| saw  | a sawtooth wave |
